# Suggestion Rules

We accept suggestions for commands as well as pull requests, but the commands should comply with these rules.

Forks aren't required to use these rules. You can reuse HUB++ modules in your module repos as long as you credit me.

## These aren't allowed in HUB++:

- Kanging entire sticker packs. That's stealing.
- Mute features that bypass Telegram's restrictions. If you can mute an admin with the feature, it's not coming.
- Racist and sexist stuff.
- NSFW (or suggestive) stuff, like the finger and OK sign animation used in almost every Paperplane fork.
- More memes. I might occasionally accept meme commands if they aren't garbage.
- Any kinds of emoji animations.
- Fake "hacking" animations.
- Malware. Commands that let the user run code (like .exec) are not considered malware.
- Commands with non-English text. Translate the text, then submit.
- Anything to do with piracy, including torrent commands, paid streaming service content downloaders etc.
